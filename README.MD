## CrickAlike: Animated Cricket Match Recreation Platform

CrickAlike is a capstone project developed to create a platform that converts pre-recorded cricket match videos into animated content using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The platform aims to recreate the events of the match in the form of engaging animations, based on the commentary provided by the commentators.

## Project Overview:
- Gathering real-life match content: Collecting pre-recorded cricket match videos to serve as the foundation for the animated scenes.
- Prototype development: Creating a proof-of-concept to showcase the potential of CrickAlike, including a presentation (PPT) to explain the concept.
- Mentor's approval: The project idea was presented to and approved by the senior teacher acting as the mentor.
- Converting videos to animation: Core functionality involves transforming specific events from cricket match videos into animated scenes, such as replicating a batsman hitting a shot to the off-side.
- Research paper integration: Various audio algorithms, including text-to-speech and audio-to-text, were extracted from relevant research papers.
- Utilizing NLP: Employing NLP techniques to process and analyze the text derived from the commentators' voice, which provides descriptions of match events.
- Machine learning application: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to understand the text descriptions and translate them into animation instructions. These algorithms learn from training data to generate accurate and visually appealing animated scenes.
- Recreation of match events: CrickAlike recreates match events by rendering characters, movements, actions, and other visual elements based on the processed text input.
- Microsoft Azure Speech Recognition: Integration of Azure Cognitive Services' Speech Recognition to convert audio commentary into text, enhancing accuracy and reliability.
- Recognition and Appreciation: The CrickAlike project received high regard as one of the best in the university and garnered significant appreciation from project panels.

By combining NLP, machine learning, animation techniques, and Microsoft Azure's Speech Recognition, CrickAlike provides users with an immersive and visually captivating way to experience real-life cricket matches.
