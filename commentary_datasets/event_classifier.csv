0," Siraj to Maharaj, out Bowled!! Maharaj's miserable stay at the crease ends in ultra-miserable fashion. Swung and missed quite a few, chewed up plenty of dot balls when he should have been giving Miller the strike, and now ensures that his partner won't be facing any more deliveries this innings. Went for an ugly heave, Siraj kept it simple, slow and straight, attacking the stumps. Maharaj missed, and saw the off stump ripped out. Maharaj b Siraj 5(13) ",0
1," Thakur to Parnell, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Parnell succumbs to the pressure! With the boundaries drying up, he tries to break the shackles but this is a craftily bowled off-cutter from Shardul. Went fuller a touch as well, inviting the big hit but Parnell could only slice this down to long-off. Iyer didn't have to budge one bit. India are pulling things back superbly in these final 10 overs. Parnell c Shreyas Iyer b Thakur 16(22) ",0
2," Washington Sundar to Markram, out Caught by Dhawan!! Two wickets in quick succession. Poor delivery and Markram has got out to that. Very slow and it takes its time to come to Markram who thrashes it off the back foot, but fails to keep it down, low and to the left of Dhawan at extra-cover who dives and comes up with the ball. Smart catch and a wry smile from Washington Sundar as he is relieved. Meanwhile Markram is furious at getting out to that ball. Markram c Dhawan b Washington Sundar 79(89) [4s-7 6s-1] ",0
3," Kuldeep Yadav to Klaasen, out Caught by Siraj!! Good running catch from long-on. The attempted googly on the stumps, does not turn though, Klaasen makes room to loft inside-out but skews it off a thick inside half, it looks to be falling in no-man's land till Siraj runs in and takes it low down, almost slipped out but he tumbles over and the ball stays intact at the end of his fingertips. Klaasen c Siraj b Kuldeep Yadav 30(26) [4s-2 6s-2] ",0
4," Siraj to R Hendricks, out Caught by Shahbaz Ahmed!! Hendricks has found deep square leg. The move to bring Siraj back has worked. A good length delivery on off-stump, again that short-arm jab from Hendricks but he fails to place it, picks out one of India's best fielders in this lineup. Time for a drink as well after that Hendricks wicket. R Hendricks c Shahbaz Ahmed b Siraj 74(76) [4s-9 6s-1] ",0
5," Shahbaz Ahmed to Janneman Malan, out Lbw!! That looked so out to the naked eye but umpire Virender Sharma surprisingly shakes his head. Shahbaz Ahmed wasa almost pleading for that one and Samson convinces Dhawan to go for the review. A flat good length delivery on middle, Malan closes the face of the bat and tries to turn that to leg, misses, rapped on the back leg and low as well. Not turning big to miss the stumps and it's three reds on ball-tracking. Maiden ODI wicket for Shahbaz Ahmed who is thrilled as he watches it on the big screen and breaks into a celebration. Janneman Malan lbw b Shahbaz Ahmed 25(31) [4s-4] ",0
6," Siraj to de Kock, out Bowled!! Dragged back on. Siraj is leaping around in joy while de Kock has a wry smile as he walks back. Full and wide outside off, makes de Kock reach out to play the square drive, he doesn't get fully across to meet it off the middle of the bat, the thick inside-edge crashes back on to the stumps. He got out that way in the opening T20I and often drags it back on. Big wicket for India. de Kock b Siraj 5(8) [4s-1] ",0
7," Thakur to Miller, FOUR, he missed out on the slot ball first-up but not this time. Slower ball, Miller heaves and didn't middle it that well again. Dragged it off the inside half a fraction, but placed it right between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket ",1
8," Thakur to Miller, FOUR, this is a sledgehammer blow! Shardul did well to get out of the way in time. Tried the yorker but Miller came charging, converted this into a low full toss and bashed it straight back past the bowler. Went to the fence in a jiffy ",1
9," Siraj to Maharaj, byes, FOUR, now this is a comedy of errors! Dhawan and Siraj aren't happy with the call! But it does seem a fair one to be honest. Was another play-and-a-miss from Maharaj, got beaten on the inside edge. Samson threw the ball back to Siraj who then had an angry throw at the non-striker's stumps. Don't think he was trying for a run out there, was more of a frustration there but the throw misses big time and mid-on had no chance. Overthrows given. India are unhappy because they thought the ball was dead. But it's the umpire's job to decide that and they felt it was live ",1
10," Kuldeep Yadav to Miller, FOUR, cracking shot! Just a bit too short, width offered and Miller in this peak form isn't missing out. Rocked back and crashed it through extra cover. Top shot ",1
11," Washington Sundar to Miller, FOUR, cheeky from Miller! Walked across early, forcing Sundar to attack the stumps but this is a bit too straight and flat. All that pace is used for a fine lap sweep, past Samson quite easily and short fine had no chance ",1
12," Avesh Khan to Klaasen, FOUR, this is another shot that Klaasen plays so well. Is on the front foot, stays there, bends his back a little and pulls the back of a length delivery on off-stump over mid-wicket, one bounce over the ropes ",1
13," Washington Sundar to Klaasen, FOUR, wow that is pristine timing+the short boundary at deep backward square leg - it races away for four to leave Washington Sundar and Dhawan wondering. Just a neat tuck off the back foot through the backward square leg region and gives Thakur no chance from deep square leg ",1
14," Washington Sundar to Markram, FOUR, no sweeper cover or deep cover and Washington Sundar drags it down, Markram rocks back and cuts wide of extra-cover to his left ",1
15," Avesh Khan to R Hendricks, FOUR, Ishan Kishan got there from sweeper cover but the ball goes under his hands on the dive and he gives away four. Should've stopped that. A flashing cut from Hendricks and it raced across the turf ",1
16," Shahbaz Ahmed to R Hendricks, FOUR, so easy. So smooth. So fluid. A bit of air outside off, just a bit and Hendricks gets forward and plays the lofted inside-out drive wide of long-off for four ",1
17," Avesh Khan to R Hendricks, FOUR, the short ball outside off, sits up and begs to be hit, Hendricks thumps it with both feet off the air wide of mid-wicket and that rocketed to the fence ",1
18," Shahbaz Ahmed to Markram, FOUR, bit too full on the stumps and Markram gets forward, opens the face of the bat and gets it in the gap, the drive goes wide of cover and there's a huge gap between sweeper cover and wide long-off ",1
19," Kuldeep Yadav to R Hendricks, FOUR, magnificent inside-out drive over extra-cover. Tossed up just outside off, Hendricks gets forward and lofts with class and elegance for a one bounce over the ropes four ",1
20," Thakur to Markram, FOUR, Markram has timed that so well. Siraj has little distance to cover from long-on but doesn't get there. It's a good length delivery on the stumps, Markram comes on the front foot and creams it straight down the ground, beats Siraj's dive to his left ",1
21," Thakur to R Hendricks, FOUR, Chris Morris on air previously informed everyone that Hendricks was an exceptional hockey player in his younger days. This is full on the pads, a whip-flick with tremendous wrists and the ball sails over mid-wicket. Similar to a drag-flick off a penalty corner in Hockey ",1
22," Washington Sundar to R Hendricks, FOUR, so easy with the field - mid-off is up, it's tossed up outside off, Hendricks gets forward and lofts through the line over mid-off and it's a one bounce over the ropes four ",1
23," Washington Sundar to Markram, FOUR, wierd field this - the long-on is very wide and Markram gets four as he gets forward and drives to the orthodox long-on ",1
24," Thakur to Markram, FOUR, fine drive from Markram as he gets forward and drives the full ball just outside off wide of cover and mid-off. Races away. Lovely extension of the arms ",1
25," Washington Sundar to Markram, FOUR, cute and deft. Markram gets across his stumps, the line is on leg-stump, he paddles a boundary to the fine-leg region ",1
26," Siraj to R Hendricks, FOUR, full and sliding down the pads, poor delivery and Hendricks flicks fine and beats fine-leg to his right. That raced off the bat ",1
27," Siraj to Markram, FOUR, Markram nails the pull off the front foot. This short ball on the stumps, sits up and Markram pulls wide of deep square leg ",1
28," Shahbaz Ahmed to R Hendricks, FOUR, drifting into the pads, Hendricks knows there's no deep mid-wicket and deliberately flicks in the air there, easy boundary ",1
29," Avesh Khan to Janneman Malan, FOUR, nice clip. Fullish and angling into Janneman Malan on the pads, he gets forward and pierces the tiny gap between mid-wicket and mid-on. Consecutive fours to end the over ",1
30," Avesh Khan to Janneman Malan, FOUR, Janneman Malan is always looking to be positive. This is a wide good length delivery outside off, carved up and over point ",1
31," Shahbaz Ahmed to Janneman Malan, FOUR, tremendous shot from Janneman Malan. He can be so pleasing to the eye. He comes down the track and eases the drive wide of extra-cover and the ball races away. Supreme timing ",1
32,"Siraj to R Hendricks, FOUR, Hendricks bends his head as he sees the short ball on the stumps and then thumps it wide of square leg for four. A cracking pull",1
33," Siraj to Janneman Malan, FOUR, superb back foot punch and four. On a short of length outside off, Janneman Malan stands tall and punches wide of the diving cover to his left, races away. Ishan Kishan with the dive and the ball goes under the dive ",1
34," Siraj to de Kock, FOUR, de Kock starts with a boundary. The seam is wobbling as it comes out but it's a half-volley on the stumps, driven straight down the ground with a full face for four ",1
35," Kuldeep Yadav to Klaasen, SIX, superb use of the feet. Klaasen shimmies down the track and lofts the tossed up delivery on the stumps, allt he way over long-off. A mighty hit too and clean off the middle of the bat ",2
36," Shahbaz Ahmed to Klaasen, SIX, this is a Klaasen trademark shot. Rocking back and converting the good length delivery on the stumps into a shorter one, a pull over mid-wicket and the ball sails over the fence ",2
37," Washington Sundar to Markram, SIX, sliding into the pads, Markram quickly goes down on one knee and swings it away to the deep backward square leg fence, not a big boundary and he clears it easily ",2
38,"Kuldeep Yadav to R Hendricks, SIX, not hit well but clears the leaping and outstretched hands of Ishan Kishan at deep mid-wicket. The conventional leggie and Hendricks miscued the heave, but gets away. Was always going away from Ishan who flung himself outside the cushions, but fails in his attempt to save that hit",2
39," Fortuin to Ishan Kishan, out Caught by R Hendricks!! Oh dear! Ishan Kishan cannot believe it. He is down on his haunches and does not want to leave. Gotta feel for him as he played a superb knock. Perhaps the best in his brief international career. Looked set for a maiden hundred on his home ground and opportunities like these don't come too often. He played the pull so well today and got plenty of sixes playing that shot, but not this time. He was quick to latch onto the short ball but doesn't quite time it as well as he would have liked, drags it off the thick inside half and Reeza Hendricks takes a well-judged tumbling catch at deep mid-wicket. Ishan Kishan c R Hendricks b Fortuin 93(84) [4s-4 6s-7] ",0
40," Rabada to Shubman Gill, out Caught&Bowled!! What an athlete Rabada is. Makes the return catch look so simple. And he brings out the aeroplane celebration as well. Shubman Gill is shocked as are the Ranchi crowd. They can't seem to believe that Rabada has taken that. Full on off, a push-drive, again great timing just that Gill fails to keep it down, near the ankles of Rabada who bends down and takes it with two hands. Made it look easy - when it was anything but. Not sure many fast bowlers currently could've pulled off such a catch. The dangerous Gill goes and South Africa have both the openers. Shubman Gill c and b Rabada 28(26) [4s-5] ",0
41," Parnell to Dhawan, out Bowled!! Parnell gets Dhawan again. Second time in two games. A big smile from Dhawan after the off-stump goes for a walk. Parnell after swinging it in the first couple of overs, has pulled his length back and keeping it straight on the stumps on a low and slow wicket. Dhawan comes down the track and looks to play across the line to a good length on off, the body shape and balance are all awry and the off-stump goes for a spin. Parnell is delighted and South Africa have their first. Dhawan b Parnell 13(20) [6s-1] ",0
42," Nortje to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, Iyer fittingly finishes things and it's 1-1! A classy square-drive to cap things off, was a wide half-volley and with the field up on the off-side, Iyer could pick his spot. He decided to get it through backward point ",1
43," Nortje to Samson, FOUR, okay, Samson decides to give the T20 fans some finishing joy. Stays back and uses all of the pace on this shortish delivery with a delightful late dab. Tried it off Nortje's last over, was denied by some great fielding but third man can't do anything this time ",1
44," Rabada to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, makes the Free Hit count, gets to his 2nd ODI ton! Knew the short ball is coming, backed away early and slapped it away over extra cover. Not the ideal connection but with the field up, he played the percentages well there. A fine knock from Iyer, his ODI form has always been very good and he continues to impress in the 50-over format ",1
45," Maharaj to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, cut away! Just a tad short and that's enough for Iyer who sits deep in his crease and late cuts this away. Short third man could have perhaps done better, but it was struck well too ",1
46," Fortuin to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, whacked! Short, wide, and Iyer dispatches it. Sits deep in the crease and cuts it away square, beating short third man comfortably to his right ",1
47," Fortuin to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, dropped short just outside off, Shreyas Iyer jumps on the back foot and cuts it really late to the left of cover, excellent timing and placement ",1
48," Nortje to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, one bounce and over the ropes! The faster you come, the further you travel. Short ball, doesn't rise as much and Ishan Kishan makes full use of the pace to nail the pull over mid-wicket ",1
49," Rabada to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, short and wide at 133ks, Shreyas Iyer says thank you and smacks the cut past the diving right hand of backward point ",1
50," Parnell to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, poor bowling this from Parnell. With mid-off inside the ring he bowls a full delivery wide of off, Shreyas Iyer uses his long levers and lifts it over the infield with an air of nonchalance ",1
51," Parnell to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, 131ks pitched full and in the slot outside off, Shreyas Iyer smashes the drive straight and beats the diving effort of mid-off to his right ",1
52," Rabada to Ishan Kishan, no ball, FOUR, it's a gentle length delivery and to make matters worse, it's a front foot no ball as well. Oh dear! Ishan Kishan stays back and nails the pull in the gap through mid-wicket, no chance for the fielder in the deep ",1
53," Markram to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, fifty for Shreyas Iyer now. Sees a full one outside off and he slams the drive to the left of cover. The timing on the shot takes care of the rest ",1
54," Markram to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, Shreyas Iyer is one of the best against spin in India and he is proving why! Uses his feet, gets closer to the pitch of the delivery and smacks it wide of long-on with bottom-handed whip ",1
55," Fortuin to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, nicely played! Drops it short outside off, Shreyas Iyer waited that extra second on the back foot and cut it late crisply in the gap between cover and backward point ",1
56," Markram to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, poor ball to start with and it gets even poorer with a shabby fielding effort. Dragged short outside off, Shreyas Iyer slogs it to the right of deep square who fumbles on the dive and parries it to the boundary ropes ",1
57," Rabada to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, deliberately done and four. On a short of length on off, Ishan Kishan opens the face of the bat and glides it well wide of de Kock. No chance for third man ",1
58," Nortje to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, two glorious shots from Shreyas Iyer and that has got the crowd going. Full just outside off, Shreyas Iyer now leans into the cover drive and times it so well, that it beats cover and also the run and dive from sweeper cover where Malan tries his best but fails ",1
59," Nortje to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, 144.6kph good length and a hint of width outside off, Shreyas Iyer flashes a cut and beats the substitute Jansen running and diving at third man. Again tremendous timing on that ",1
60," Parnell to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, fine shot. On a good length and outside off, hint of width and Shreyas Iyer latches on. Stays back and punches the square drive hard into the ground, wide of point and down to the boundary ",1
61," Rabada to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, nice square drive from Ishan Kishan and he gets it in the gap past short cover-point and point. Full outside off, Kishan throws the bat at the drive but is in control, right into the gap ",1
62," Parnell to Shubman Gill, FOUR, Shubman Gill is dealing in boundaries. Another wow shot. Full outside off, he leans into the cover drive and leaves everyone on the field and off it, gasping in awe and amazement at the shot. Such a silky-smooth drive ",1
63," Parnell to Shubman Gill, FOUR, can't bowl half-vollies to Shubman Gill in this kind of nick. Full outside off, eased past extra-cover and cover for a boundary ",1
64," Rabada to Shubman Gill, FOUR, what timing. That has raced to the fence. A good length delivery on the pads, flicked through backward square leg and it just purrs off the bat ",1
65," Parnell to Shubman Gill, FOUR, people from the cricketing world talk about the cover drives of Babar and Kohli but Shubman Gill is right up there with those two. Full just outside off, a controlled leant push-drive with a high elbow and beats the dive of cover to his right and races away. That's one for the photographer's - absolute delight! ",1
66," Parnell to Shubman Gill, FOUR, what a start for Shubman Gill. A floaty half-volley on middle, the inswinger and Shubman Gill flicks wide of mid-wicket for a pleasing boundary ",1
67," Rabada to Samson, SIX, Samson joins in the fun now! He smartly played it safe till Shreyas Iyer got his century and with the target also in sight now, decides to open up. Cracking shot too! Was fractionally short, he just stood tall and muscled the pull over wide long-on. Towering blow! ",2
68," Nortje to Ishan Kishan, SIX, first ball after that blow on that elbow and Ishan Kishan has dispatched Nortje over fine leg. 128ks short outside off, Ishan Kishan swivels and pulls it to the left of fine leg where Malan attempts a dive, but to no avail ",2
69," Nortje to Ishan Kishan, SIX, 145ks half-volley on the stumps, Ishan Kishan clears his front leg and marmalizes it deep into the mid-wicket stands ",2
70," Nortje to Ishan Kishan, SIX, ccccrrrrruuunnnnccchhhheeeddddddd! Short ball right in the arc outside off and Ishan Kishan has butchered that for a 92-metre maximum over mid-wicket ",2
71," Fortuin to Ishan Kishan, SIX, mighty! Ishan Kishan clearly likes the left-arm spin. Waltzes down the track, doesn't really get to the pitch of the delivery but still goes through with the swing and lifts it into the stands over long-off. A shade of Rishabh Pant in that shot from Ishan Kishan ",2
72," Maharaj to Ishan Kishan, SIX, fraction short and Ishan Kishan is onto it in a flash! Swivels on the back foot and thrashes the pull flat and long over deep mid-wicket ",2
73," Maharaj to Ishan Kishan, SIX, launched! Short and speedy outside off, Ishan Kishan rocks back and mauls the pull into the mid-wicket orbit. Brings up India's 100 as well ",2
74," Maharaj to Ishan Kishan, SIX, dragged down too short and Ishan Kishan pounces. He rocks back and pummels the pull into the crowd at deep mid-wicket ",2
75," Fortuin to Dhawan, SIX, Dhawan tried that shot last over, this time he gets six over wide long-on. Rushes out and is to the pitch, flicked away ",2
76," Ravi Bishnoi to de Kock, out Lbw!! That looked dead as soon as de Kock missed it but he still challenged the decision, South Africa lose the review. It is the reverse sweep that has brought about his downfall, Bishnoi pushed it through and dragged the length back as well, de Kock does not get anything and is struck right in front of the stumps. No doubt in umpire Anil Chaudhary's mind and India have got a massive wicket. de Kock lbw b Ravi Bishnoi 48(54) [4s-5] ",0
77,"Kuldeep Yadav to Markram, out Bowled!! Whoa! That's another beauty to get rid of Markram. Kuldeep had him in a web from the first ball and it seemed only a matter of time before Markram was sent packing. This is a conventional chinaman, drifts across the right hander and spins back in sharply, Markram plunges forward to defend but the ball finds a gap between bat and pad, goes on to hit the top of off-stump and Kuldeep enjoyed that. The ball brushed the front pad but not enough to save Markram. Markram b Kuldeep Yadav 0(5)",0
78," Thakur to Bavuma, out Bowled!! Jaffa! This is a peach from Thakur and Bavuma had no answer to that. The nip-backer from a fullish length and Bavuma is beaten by the exaggerated movement, he attempts a forward push away from the body and leaves a gap between bat and pad, the ball sneaks through to hit off and middle-stump. Bavuma's woes on this tour continue.. Bavuma b Thakur 8(12) [4s-2] ",0
79," Thakur to Janneman Malan, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! That drop catch doesn't cost much. Shardul Thakur is delighted. Sends in a full delivery at the pads and entices Janneman Malan into an aerial whip/flick. The ball seemed to have stopped a touch and it flies off the thick toe-end towards Iyer at mid-wicket. Catching practice. Janneman Malan c Shreyas Iyer b Thakur 22(42) [4s-3] ",0
80," Ravi Bishnoi to Klaasen, FOUR, cheeky and four, nicely tossed up outside off, Klaasen bends down low, reversed his stance and then sweeps it backward of square on the off-side for a boundary ",1
81," Avesh Khan to Miller, FOUR, another fumble, India's fielding has ben poor in this over, the wide yorker from Avesh - Miller backed away and then had to reach out on the drive, toe-ends it straight to the fielder at backward point who lets it go straight through him ",1
82," Siraj to Klaasen, FOUR, cracking shot, much better from Klaasen - backs away to a slower short ball and then cuts it up and over backward point, always a safe shot with no one in the deep, bounces away to the ropes ",1
83," Thakur to Miller, FOUR, crunched, back of a length and at the stumps, Miller swivels across, rolled his wrists and then pulled it past square leg, slid away across the fast outfield and past Ruturaj's sliding effort ",1
84," Thakur to Miller, FOUR, easy pickings for Miller, short of a length and angling into the pads, Miller gets inside the line and flicks it fine, runs away to the long leg boundary ",1
85,"Ravi Bishnoi to Klaasen, FOUR, cracking shot, a half-tracker from Bishnoi, Klaasen rocks back and pummels the pull over mid-wicket, right in the gap, one bounce and over the ropes",1
86," Kuldeep Yadav to Miller, FOUR, first ball against Kuldeep and Miller brings out the sweep, he fetches it from outside off and strikes in front of square to the vacant deep mid-wicket region ",1
87," Ravi Bishnoi to Miller, FOUR, Miller is off and running. Half tracker from Bishnoi and Miller was not missing out, he quickly transfers his weight back and cracks the cut in front of square. No one at sweeper cover to stop that ",1
88," Siraj to Klaasen, FOUR, unlucky! Another well-directed short ball and Klaasen once again was trying to evade taking his eyes off, the ball brushes the glove and flies over a leaping Samson ",1
89," Siraj to de Kock, FOUR, cheeky! de Kock knows there's no fine leg in place, so he moves across his stumps and laps the back of a length delivery to the vacant region ",1
90," Kuldeep Yadav to Klaasen, FOUR, shot! This time the sweep works. Klaasen picks the chinaman and sweeps it with the spin to deep square leg, bisected the two fielders in the deep perfectly ",1
91," Avesh Khan to Klaasen, FOUR, fullish delivery and Klaasen checked his on-drive, chips it past de Kock and luckily it is wide of Thakur at mid-on, once it passes the infield there's no stopping that ",1
92," Thakur to de Kock, FOUR, streaky! Good length ball angled across off, de Kock goes for the drives and plays outside the line, the inside edge flies past the stumps and races to fine leg ",1
93," Ravi Bishnoi to Bavuma, FOUR, massive over, 16 runs. All the pressure built in the last few overs have been let go. Overcooks the flighted delivery outside off and Bavuma does not miss out, he opens the bat face and square drives it through point, giving sweeper cover no chance of stopping the ball ",1
94," Ravi Bishnoi to Bavuma, no ball, FOUR, off the mark with an audacious reverse sweep. It was the googly and Bavuma picked it from outside leg-stump and swept it square on the off-side. Bishnoi has overstepped ",1
95," Ravi Bishnoi to de Kock, FOUR, loads it full and just outside off, QDK stays low and hammers the sweep behind square on the leg-side. Timed it really well and got the desired result ",1
96," Ravi Bishnoi to de Kock, FOUR, cheeky from QDK! Picks the googly just outside off and plays the latest of cuts to get it past Dhawan's left at slip ",1
97," Avesh Khan to Janneman Malan, FOUR, much-needed boundary for South Africa. You cannot be bowling short to the Proteas. Not when there isn't a great deal of bounce on the deck. 133ks angled into the body and Malan slams the pull square on the leg-side ",1
98," Siraj to Janneman Malan, FOUR, 131ks short ball with no venom, Malan swivels and powers the pull to the right of fine leg. Siraj isn't happy with the effort of the fielder? Or perhaps he isn't happy with himself for bowling that line? ",1
99," Siraj to Janneman Malan, FOUR, signature Janneman Malan! He loves the punch through covers and does not put too much effort on the front foot. Just sits comfortably in the crease and times it sweetly in the gap on the off-side ",1
100," Avesh Khan to de Kock, FOUR, stand and deliver! de Kock does not overcomplicate things. He sees a full ball in the outside off channel and the hands take over, driven crisply and beats mid-off to his left quite comfortably ",1
101," Siraj to Miller, SIX, short, wide and slapped over extra-cover for a maximum, easy for Miller - gets on top of the bounce and crunches the cut over cover, poor delivery and it was duly dismissed ",2
102," Avesh Khan to Miller, SIX, smashed, back of a length and at the stumps, no rewal venom on that delivery from Avesh, Miller rides the bounce and then thumps the pull into the stands at deep mid-wicket ",2
103," Avesh Khan to Klaasen, SIX, creamed, Avesh missed his yorker by an inch, Klaasen had backed away, got underneath the length, opens the face of the bat and then lifted it over cover, went sailing over the ropes for a maximum, 12 from the over ",2
104," Kuldeep Yadav to Klaasen, SIX, lovely, Kuldeep tosses one invitingly around off, Klaasen stays leg-sided and then goes inside out over cover with the drive, sent it soaring over the ropes for a maximum ",2
105," Ravi Bishnoi to Miller, SIX, fabulous shot! Bit more flight and there was width outside off, Miller just extends his arms and lofts it over mid-off. That was a safe shot with the fielder inside the ring ",2
106,"Rabada to Avesh Khan, out Caught by Bavuma!! South Africa are closing the match in some style - hard length from Rabada, Avesh backed away on the slog, hit low on the bat and it's a steepler for Bavuma, he watches it all along, went reverse cupped and held on. Avesh Khan c Bavuma b Rabada 3(6)",0
107,"Ngidi to Kuldeep Yadav, out Caught by Bavuma!! A back-pedalling Bavuma holds onto a screamer and India are losing their way now. Was another slower ball from Ngidi - Kuldeep was early into the lofted drive, chipped it lamely and over extra-cover, Bavuma ran back, kept his eyes on the ball and completed a tumbling catch. Landed on his left shoulder and winced, but hasn't caused any damage onto himself. Kuldeep Yadav c Bavuma b Ngidi 0(1)",0
108,"Ngidi to Thakur, out Caught by Maharaj!! That's the wicket South Africa were after - Shardul is livid with himself, was right in the slot, but he didn't get the placement on the drive, hit hard and to the left of mid-off where Maharaj moved across and cusped it neatly. Was pitched up and Shardul went hard on the drive, skewed it slightly and that cost him his wicket. Thakur c Maharaj b Ngidi 33(31) [4s-5]",0
109," Ngidi to Shreyas Iyer, out Caught by Rabada!! There's the wicket and most probably the game. Ngidi kept hitting the deck hard and the line was also tight. Iyer just couldn't get it away and he perishes trying to play the big shot. This was a short of length delivery and Iyer is deceived by the extra bounce, the pull comes off the higher part of the bat and the ball lobs to mid-on, simple catch to Rabada. Shreyas Iyer c Rabada b Ngidi 50(37) [4s-8] ",0
110," Maharaj to Ishan Kishan, out Caught by Janneman Malan!! Both set batters sent back in successive overs. The South African spinners are casting a web on this batting line-up. But credit to Bavuma for having a leg slip. Kishan comes down the track and is deceived in the air, he tries to fend it away but the ball spins in and takes the inside edge to leg slip, Malan hangs on to the dolly and India slip further.

112," Parnell to Dhawan, out Bowled!! Chopped on once again! The pressure of 20 successive dot balls?

Both openers are gone. Dhawan b Parnell 4(16) ",0
