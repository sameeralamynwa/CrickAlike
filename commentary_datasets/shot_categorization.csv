This is a conventional chinaman, drifts across the right hander and spins back in sharply, Markram plunges forward to defend but the ball finds a gap between bat and pad, goes on to hit the top of off-stump and Kuldeep enjoyed that.

432," Thakur to Janneman Malan, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! That drop catch doesn't cost much. Shardul Thakur is delighted. Sends in a full delivery at the pads and entices Janneman Malan into an aerial whip/flick. The ball seemed to have stopped a touch and it flies off the thick toe-end towards Iyer at mid-wicket.

505," Siraj to Janneman Malan, no run, fuller and seaming in outside off, Janneman Malan is happy to shoulder arms ",0
506," Nortje to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, Iyer fittingly finishes things and it's 1-1! A classy square-drive to cap things off, was a wide half-volley and with the field up on the off-side, Iyer could pick his spot. He decided to get it through backward point ",1

510," Nortje to Samson, FOUR, okay, Samson decides to give the T20 fans some finishing joy. Stays back and uses all of the pace on this shortish delivery with a delightful late dab. Tried it off Nortje's last over, was denied by some great fielding but third man can't do anything this time ",1
511," Parnell to Samson, 1 run, well, they are actually doing this in singles. Sure the purists will love this, not the modern day folks. Fuller length ball, Samson gets a faint inside edge on the flick and this goes off the back pad towards short third man ",0

A fine knock from Iyer, his ODI form has always been very good and he continues to impress in the 50-over format ",1
528," Rabada to Shreyas Iyer, no ball, slower and fuller outside off, Iyer defends with soft hands. Now then, Rabada has overstepped an and Iyer can't ask for a better way to get to 100 ",0

535," Maharaj to Samson, no run, drifting in from around off, Samson defends gently to the off-side ",0
536," Rabada to Shreyas Iyer, 2 runs, shortish, leg-lined, Iyer gets inside the line and plays a stylish half-pull. Once agai as it has been all through this evening, the timing is fab. Malan from deep square leg did well moving to his left, sliding well and has saved a brace for his side ",0

538," Rabada to Shreyas Iyer, 1 run, short ball, but no venom or height on this, Iyer stands tall and pulls it away nicely to the left of deep square leg ",0

552," Fortuin to Shreyas Iyer, no run, excellent decision from the umpire! Initial thinking was that there was an inside edge that saved Iyer. Because he was struck on the back leg, and it was quite full too. As it turns out, flat line on UltraEdge, but ball tracking shows it to be missing leg stump. Was fired in by Fortuin, Iyer made a hint of room for the slog and that's what has saved him here. Got himself close to leg stump or thereabouts, with the angle taking it further down. Was an ungainly slog from Iyer though, an understandably tired shot ",0
553," Fortuin to Samson, 1 run, slower and shorter, Samson stays back and cuts it away to deep point ",0
554," Maharaj to Shreyas Iyer, 2 runs, his timing has been on another level tonight! Half-tracker down leg, poor ball and Iyer responds with an elegant back foot flick. Wristed away to the left of deep square leg who does well to get across with a slide. Iyer moves into the 80s ",0

575," Fortuin to Ishan Kishan, out Caught by R Hendricks!! Oh dear! Ishan Kishan cannot believe it. He is down on his haunches and does not want to leave. Gotta feel for him as he played a superb knock. Perhaps the best in his brief international career. Looked set for a maiden hundred on his home ground and opportunities like these don't come too often. He played the pull so well today and got plenty of sixes playing that shot, but not this time. He was quick to latch onto the short ball but doesn't quite time it as well as he would have liked, drags it off the thick inside half and Reeza Hendricks takes a well-judged tumbling catch at deep mid-wicket.

725," Parnell to Shreyas Iyer, no run, fullish outside off, Shreyas Iyer gets forward and times the push-drive to cover-point ",0
726," Parnell to Shreyas Iyer, 2 runs, Malan at cover-point goes quickly to his right and dives to save a certain boundary. This was again sweetly timed off the back foot by Shreyas Iyer and was heading for four ",0

728," Parnell to Shreyas Iyer, no run, good length and angling into middle and leg, Shreyas Iyer gets an inside-edge on the back foot defence, on to the back thigh and then it rolls just wide of leg-stump.

729," Parnell to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR, fine shot. On a good length and outside off, hint of width and Shreyas Iyer latches on. Stays back and punches the square drive hard into the ground, wide of point and down to the boundary ",1
730," Rabada to Shreyas Iyer, 1 run, short of length on the pads, Shreyas Iyer is off the mark with a tuck to deep backward square leg. There is a chance of one more as there is an overthrow but they settle for one ",0
731," Rabada to Shubman Gill, out Caught&Bowled!! What an athlete Rabada is. Makes the return catch look so simple. And he brings out the aeroplane celebration as well. Shubman Gill is shocked as are the Ranchi crowd. They can't seem to believe that Rabada has taken that. Full on off, a push-drive, again great timing just that Gill fails to keep it down, near the ankles of Rabada who bends down and takes it with two hands. Made it look easy - when it was anything but. Not sure many fast bowlers currently could've pulled off such a catch. The dangerous Gill goes and South Africa have both the openers.  Shubman Gill c and b Rabada 28(26) [4s-5] ",1
732," Rabada to Ishan Kishan, 1 run, good length on off-stump, tight delivery, defended in front of mid-off and Ishan Kishan calls Shubman Gill through for a quick single ",0

736," Parnell to Shubman Gill, FOUR, Shubman Gill is dealing in boundaries. Another wow shot. Full outside off, he leans into the cover drive and leaves everyone on the field and off it, gasping in awe and amazement at the shot. Such a silky-smooth drive ",1
737," Parnell to Shubman Gill, no run, good length outside off, Shubman Gill plays a horizontal bat dab and chops it off a thick under-edge not far away to his right ",0
738," Parnell to Shubman Gill, no run, slower delivery on a fuller length outside off, Shubman Gill eases a drive to cover off the front foot ",0

741," Parnell to Shubman Gill, FOUR, can't bowl half-vollies to Shubman Gill in this kind of nick. Full outside off, eased past extra-cover and cover for a boundary ",1
742," Rabada to Ishan Kishan, no run, edged and did that carry to de Kock? He wears a disappointed look on his face. Angling into off-stump from a good length and making Ishan Kishan play, thick outside-edge and inches short of the left hand of de Kock ",0
743," Rabada to Ishan Kishan, no run, pitched up outside off, left alone ",0
744," Rabada to Ishan Kishan, no run, fullish outside off, Ishan Kishan gets forward and opens the face of the bat to steer to the right of backward point who dives to cut it off ",0
745," Rabada to Shubman Gill, 1 run, fullish and targetting off-stump, Shubman Gill again with good timing as he shows the full face of the bat to drive to the left of mid-on ",0
746," Rabada to Shubman Gill, FOUR, what timing. That has raced to the fence. A good length delivery on the pads, flicked through backward square leg and it just purrs off the bat ",1
747," Rabada to Shubman Gill, 2 runs, good length just outside off, Shubman Gill punches in the air but wide of cover and the cover-point fielder chases it and keeps it to a couple ",0
748," Parnell to Dhawan, out Bowled!! Parnell gets Dhawan again. Second time in two games. A big smile from Dhawan after the off-stump goes for a walk. Parnell after swinging it in the first couple of overs, has pulled his length back and keeping it straight on the stumps on a low and slow wicket. Dhawan comes down the track and looks to play across the line to a good length on off, the body shape and balance are all awry and the off-stump goes for a spin. Parnell is delighted and South Africa have their first.  Dhawan b Parnell 13(20) [6s-1] ",1
749," Parnell to Shubman Gill, 1 run, Rabada at mid-on does not even try and cut off that single, tapped in front of him and he allows the single ",0
750," Parnell to Shubman Gill, no run, good length and just outside off, Shubman Gill gets forward to drive to mid-off ",0
751," Parnell to Dhawan, 1 run, this time Dhawan steps out and pushes the good length delivery in front of off-stump to mid-off and takes a quick single ",0

754," Fortuin to Dhawan, 1 run, fullish on the pads, Dhawan gets forward and flicks to deep mid-wicket ",0
755," Fortuin to Dhawan, 2 runs, slower and enough time for Dhawan to whip that off the back foot wide of deep mid-wicket for a couple ",0
756," Fortuin to Dhawan, no run, good length outside off, punched to extra-cover ",0
757," Fortuin to Shubman Gill, 1 run, flat good length on the stumps, clipped through mid-wicket ",0
758," Fortuin to Dhawan, 1 run, again Dhawan comes down the track and punches in front of Miller at mid-off, who comes forward to field and it deflects off his toe, but the batters are happy with one ",0
759," Fortuin to Dhawan, SIX, Dhawan tried that shot last over, this time he gets six over wide long-on. Rushes out and is to the pitch, flicked away ",1
760," Parnell to Shubman Gill, no run, good length inswinger coming in to the pads, clipped to square leg ",0
761," Parnell to Shubman Gill, no run, good length and tight on off, defended off the back foot ",0
762," Parnell to Shubman Gill, FOUR, people from the cricketing world talk about the cover drives of Babar and Kohli but Shubman Gill is right up there with those two. Full just outside off, a controlled leant push-drive with a high elbow and beats the dive of cover to his right and races away. That's one for the photographer's - absolute delight! ",1
763," Parnell to Shubman Gill, no run, width outside off but skids through from a good length and keeps a fraction low, Shubman Gill cuts and misses ",0
764," Parnell to Shubman Gill, no run, fullish just outside off, Shubman Gill gets forward to defend to cover ",0

768," Fortuin to Shubman Gill, 1 run, full on the pads, flicked to deep mid-wicket ",0
769," Fortuin to Dhawan, 1 run, just short of the forward-diving Reeza at deep mid-wicket. Dhawan comes down the track and flicks in the air, does not get hold of it, and gets lucky. Terrific effort from Reeza though to dive and get to it ",0
770," Fortuin to Shubman Gill, 1 run, stump to stump line from Fortuin, driven back and he throws it back and hits the stumps at de Kock's end, the ball rolls away and the batters take a run. de Kock with a smile asks umpire Virender Sharma if it's a dead-ball or not, gets a smile in return ",0
771," Fortuin to Shubman Gill, no run, full on off, pushed off the front foot to cover ",0
772," Parnell to Dhawan, no run, no timing at all as Dhawan comes down the track to try and upset Parnell, mistimes the drive back to the bowler ",0
773," Parnell to Shubman Gill, 2 wides, swing for Parnell but slips it down leg, it swings after beating the flick of Shubman Gill, de Kock dives to his left but parries it to fine-leg ",0

777," Parnell to Shubman Gill, no run, Parnell goes full again, on off, Shubman Gill gets forward to drive to mid-on ",0

779," Fortuin to Dhawan, no run, Fortuin's first over in T20Is is a maiden. Dhawan gets forward and drives it back ",0
780," Fortuin to Dhawan, no run, stump to stump line, Dhawan punches it back ",0

784," Fortuin to Dhawan, no run, stays a fraction low on off-stump, Dhawan defends off the back foot ",0
785," Siraj to Fortuin, leg byes, 1 run, slower ball, follows the backing away Fortuin who misses the heave, and this goes off the pads to point. SA finish on 278! ",0
786," Siraj to Maharaj, out Bowled!! Maharaj's miserable stay at the crease ends in ultra-miserable fashion. Swung and missed quite a few, chewed up plenty of dot balls when he should have been giving Miller the strike, and now ensures that his partner won't be facing any more deliveries this innings. Went for an ugly heave, Siraj kept it simple, slow and straight, attacking the stumps. Maharaj missed, and saw the off stump ripped out. Maharaj b Siraj 5(13) ",1
787," Siraj to Maharaj, no run, another play-and-a-miss from Maharaj! Looks for the reverse paddle, that shot is simply not on with the track slowing down a lot. Doesn't connect ",0
788," Siraj to Miller, 1 run, slower and shorter outside off, Miller makes room and then has to really stretch to reach this. Pulls it straight to deep mid-wicket. Just a single ",0
789," Siraj to Maharaj, 1 run, slower and shorter around off, Maharaj pulls hard but can only get an under-edge onto the body. Trickles near him and they race through for a single ",0
790," Siraj to Maharaj, no run, swing and a miss! Slower and fuller, Maharaj swings hard but it sneaks under the blade. He's got to be smart here, Maharaj, has to give the strike back to Miller surely ",0
791," Thakur to Miller, FOUR, he missed out on the slot ball first-up but not this time. Slower ball, Miller heaves and didn't middle it that well again. Dragged it off the inside half a fraction, but placed it right between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket ",1
792," Thakur to Miller, FOUR, this is a sledgehammer blow! Shardul did well to get out of the way in time. Tried the yorker but Miller came charging, converted this into a low full toss and bashed it straight back past the bowler. Went to the fence in a jiffy ",1
793," Thakur to Maharaj, 1 run, near-yorker, Maharaj jams it out past mid-wicket ",0
794," Thakur to Miller, 1 run, widish off-cutter, Miller waits and chop it to sweeper cover ",0
795," Thakur to Maharaj, 1 run, back of a length, Maharaj makes room and punches it down to long-off ",0
796," Thakur to Miller, 1 run, slot ball, there to be hit but Miller's swinging blade finds deep backward square leg with the heave. Just a single and he is fuming with himself. Just a single ",0
797," Siraj to Miller, 1 run, slower ball on the pads, Miller nudges it gently towards long-on ",0
798," Siraj to Maharaj, 1 run, full toss, Maharaj can't put it away, jams it to extra cover. Just a single ",0
799," Siraj to Maharaj, no run, slower and shorter on off, Maharaj chops this off the inside edge to mid-wicket ",0
800," Siraj to Maharaj, no run, back of a length again, Maharaj continues to play and miss ",0
801," Siraj to Maharaj, byes, FOUR, now this is a comedy of errors! Dhawan and Siraj aren't happy with the call! But it does seem a fair one to be honest. Was another play-and-a-miss from Maharaj, got beaten on the inside edge. Samson threw the ball back to Siraj who then had an angry throw at the non-striker's stumps. Don't think he was trying for a run out there, was more of a frustration there but the throw misses big time and mid-on had no chance. Overthrows given. India are unhappy because they thought the ball was dead. But it's the umpire's job to decide that and they felt it was live ",0
802," Siraj to Maharaj, no run, play and a miss! This innings has hit a complete roadblock in the last 30 minutes. Pace-off is looking unhittable at the moment and while SA aren't getting that finish they're seeking, they won't mind this pitch behavior one bit. Slower ball outside off, Maharaj makes room and is beaten on the cut ",0
803," Thakur to Miller, no run, slower and shorter, doesn't bounce at all and Miller misses the pull completely. Cops a blow near the midriff ",0
804," Thakur to Miller, no run, didn't seem to be much going for this appeal, but Samson urged his skipper for a punt, and it's not worked. Slower ball on a length outside off, Miller was beaten on the drive and this just sneaked past the inside edge through to Samson. Never seem like an inside edge, but you can understand why India gambled with the review. Miller's wicket here is of massive significance to the final score ",0
805," Thakur to Maharaj, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Maharaj stays back and jabs this towards cover-point ",0
806," Thakur to Maharaj, no run, back of a length, slower ball, Maharaj gets an under-edge on the cut, rolls towards Samson. Miller rightly declines the single ",0
807," Thakur to Parnell, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! Parnell succumbs to the pressure! With the boundaries drying up, he tries to break the shackles but this is a craftily bowled off-cutter from Shardul. Went fuller a touch as well, inviting the big hit but Parnell could only slice this down to long-off. Iyer didn't have to budge one bit. India are pulling things back superbly in these final 10 overs. Parnell c Shreyas Iyer b Thakur 16(22) ",1
808," Thakur to Parnell, no run, the slower balls keep coming, wider line, Parnell can't bat on this at all ",0
809," Siraj to Parnell, 1 run, fuller and around off, Parnell mistimes the loft, down to long-off ",0
810," Siraj to Miller, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Miller stays back and punches it away to sweeper cover ",0
811," Siraj to Miller, no run, play and a miss! Siraj has understood that pace-off is hard to get away from a shorter length and he is pounding away on that spot. Miller backed away early for the heave, but was no in position as the ball simply didn't arrive. Might have to rethink his shot-selection ",0
812," Siraj to Parnell, leg byes, 1 run, shortish on leg stump, Parnell misses the flick and this goes off the pads, down to third man. Probably a faint edge on this because the ump hasn't signalled anything ",0
813," Siraj to Miller, 1 run, back of a length around leg stump, slower ball, Miller mistimes the pull through mid-wicket ",0
814," Siraj to Miller, no run, swing and a miss! On that hard length outside off, a shade low and Miller misses the heave ",0
815," Washington Sundar to Miller, 1 run, sliding in from around leg stump, Miller gets across and pulls it away down to long-on ",0
816," Washington Sundar to Parnell, 1 run, flatter and outside off, Parnell punches it away down to long-off ",0
817," Washington Sundar to Parnell, 2 runs, outstanding stop from Iyer! Had some ground to cover to his right from long-off, and he raced across and timed the slide perfectly. Was hit hard by Parnell, rocked back and slapped this powerfully. Most days this would be a four but Iyer is arguably among the swiftest in the Indian team ",0
818," Washington Sundar to Miller, 1 run, slightly short and outside off, Miller sits back and cuts it away past point ",0
819," Washington Sundar to Parnell, 1 run, quicker and shorter, Parnell stays back and flat-bats it down to long-on ",0
820," Washington Sundar to Miller, 1 run, quicker one around off, Miller stays back and slaps it away past point ",0
821," Siraj to Miller, 1 run, back of a length around leg stump, cramps Miller who tucks it away past mid-wicket. Retains strike ",0
822," Siraj to Miller, no run, swing and a miss! Away-angler, stays a shade low and sneaks past Miller's heaving blade ",0
823," Siraj to Parnell, 1 run, slower short ball, Parnell pulls but without any timing and this trickles towards long-on. Probably a chance for the second but the batters don't want to take any risk. Last thing SA needs now is a run out ",0
824," Siraj to Parnell, no run, banged in short, rushes Parnell completely on the pull and he gets an under-edge that trickles onto the pitch near him ",0
825," Siraj to Parnell, wide, slower and shorter, well outside off and it's been wided ",0
826," Siraj to Miller, 1 run, short of a length outside off, Miller stays back and cuts it away hard through backward point. Fielder in the ring did get a hand on this to take some sting out of the shot ",0
827," Siraj to Parnell, 1 run, slower ball on the pads, Parnell nudges it away through mid-wicket ",0
828," Washington Sundar to Parnell, 1 run, quicker slider, Parnell makes room and punches it to sweeper cover ",0
829," Washington Sundar to Miller, 1 run, sliding in from around off, Miller stays back and wrists it away towards wide long-on ",0
830," Washington Sundar to Miller, no run, slower and a tad shorter, Miller hangs back and knocks this towards cover ",0
831," Washington Sundar to Parnell, 1 run, slightly short, Parnell stays back and punches it away down to long-off ",0
832," Washington Sundar to Parnell, no run, no room again, flat and straight, Parnell punche sit towards cover. Can't find the gap ",0
833," Washington Sundar to Parnell, no run, flatter and around off, Parnell stays back and jabs it to the off-side ",0
834," Kuldeep Yadav to Miller, no run, quicker one around leg stump, Miller gets across and nudges it to the leg-side ",0
835," Kuldeep Yadav to Miller, FOUR, cracking shot! Just a bit too short, width offered and Miller in this peak form isn't missing out. Rocked back and crashed it through extra cover. Top shot ",1
836," Kuldeep Yadav to Parnell, 1 run, fuller and outside off, soft hands from Parnell as he dabs it gently to the off-side. Quick single ",0
837," Kuldeep Yadav to Parnell, no run, beaten! Gets this to spin in a tad with bounce, hits Parnell on the forearm and it strikes him on the body ",0
838," Kuldeep Yadav to Miller, 1 run, drifting in on leg stump, Miller clips it behind square leg ",0
839," Kuldeep Yadav to Parnell, 1 run, nicely flighted, wider, Parnell leans forward and drives it fluently to the right of long-off who does well to keep the batters to just a single. Slid across, got to the ball and released it promptly ",0
840," Washington Sundar to Parnell, 1 run, fuller and slower, Parnell lunges and drives it down to long-off ",0
841," Washington Sundar to Miller, 1 run, shorter again, flat, Miller's back foot punch is straight towards sweeper cover this time ",0
842," Washington Sundar to Miller, 2 runs, slightly short and wide, Miller makes room and punches this well to the left of sweeper cover. Easy two ",0
843," Washington Sundar to Miller, no run, quicker and much fuller, dug out back to Sundar ",0
844," Washington Sundar to Miller, FOUR, cheeky from Miller! Walked across early, forcing Sundar to attack the stumps but this is a bit too straight and flat. All that pace is used for a fine lap sweep, past Samson quite easily and short fine had no chance ",1
845," Washington Sundar to Parnell, 1 run, fuller and outside off, driven firmly down to long-off ",0
846," Avesh Khan to Parnell, 1 run, full outside off, Parnell gets forward and drives to sweeper cover ",0

And certainly not the way he would have wanted to depart. Shubman Gill didn't respond at all and Dhawan had to go back but not in time. Dhawan run out (Marco Jansen/de Kock) 8(14) [4s-1] ",1
